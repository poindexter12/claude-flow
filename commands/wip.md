# Work In Progress

Commit only tracked (already staged or modified) files as a WIP commit. Unlike `save`, this doesn't add untracked files.

## Instructions

1. Commit tracked changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -am "wip: work in progress"
   ```

2. Report the result to the user. If nothing to commit, let them know.
